<h2><a name="gardens">GARDENS</a></h2>
      <div id="main3">
           <img class="image" src="garden.jpeg"/>
     </div>
<p class="a">&nbsp &nbsp A Garden is a planned space,usually outdoors,set aside for the display,cultivation,or enjoyment of plants 
and other forms of nature.The garden can incorporate both natural and man-made materials.The most common form today is a residential 
garden,but the term garden has traditionally been a more general one.Zoos,which display wild animals in simulated natural habitats,
were formerly called zoological gardens.Western gardens are almost universally based on plants,with gardens often signifying a shortened
form of botanical garden.Some traditional types of eastern gardens,such as Zen gardens,usually use plants sparsely or not at all.</p>
<p class="c">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Gardens may exhibit structural enhancements including statuary,follies,pergolas,trellises,
stumperies,dry creek beds and water features such as fountains,ponds(with or without fish),waterfalls or creeks.Some gardens also produce food crops 
,sometimes in seperate areas,or sometimes intermixed with the ornamental plants.Flower gardens combine plants of different heights,colors,textures
and fragrances to create interest and delight the senses.</p>
<p class="d">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Gardening is the activity of growing and maintaining the garden.This work is
done by an amateur or professional gardener.A gardener might also work in a non-garden setting,such as a park,a roadside embankment,or other public space.</p>

<h2><a name="museums">MUSEUMS</a></h2>
      <div id="main3">
           <img class="image" src="museum.jpg"/>
     </div>
<p class="e">&nbsp &nbsp A museum is an institution that cares for a collection of artifacts and other objects of artistic,cultural,historical,or scientific importance.
Many public museums make these items available for public viewing through exhibits that may be permanant or temporary.The largest museums are located in major cities throughout
the world,while thousands of local museums exist in smaller cities,towns,rural areas.Museums have varying aims,ranging from serving researchers and specialists to serving the general public.
The goal of serving researchers  is increasingly shifting to serving the general public.</p>
<p class="e">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp There are many types of museums,including art museums,natural history museums,science museums,war museums and children's museums.Amongst the world's 
largest and most visited museums are the LOUVRE in PARIS,THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF CHINA in BEIJING,THE BRITISH MUSEUM and NATIONAL GALLERY in LONDON,VATICAN MUSEUMS in VATICAN CITY,etc.According to the 
International counil of museums,there are more than 55000 museums in 202 countries.</p>
<p class="e">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Archaeology museums specialize in the display of archaeological artifacts.Many are in the open air,such as the AGORA OF ATHENS 
and the ROMAN FORUM.Others display artifacts found in archaeological sites inside buildings.Some,such as the WESTERN AUSTRALIAN MUSEUM,exhibit maritime archaeological materials.These appear in its Shipwreck Galleries,
a wing of the Maritime Museum.This Museum has also developed a 'museum-without-walls' through a series of underwater wreck trails.</p>

<h2><a name="temples">TEMPLES</a></h2>
      <div id="main3">
           <img class="image" src="temple.jpg"/>
     </div>
<p class="f">&nbsp &nbsp A Temple is a building reserved for religious or spiritual rituals and activites such as prayer and sacrifice.It is typically used for such buildings belonging to all faiths where a 
more specific term such as church,mosque or synagogue is not generally used in english.These include Hinduism,Buddhism and Jainism among religious with many modern followers,as well as other ancient religions such as Ancient 
Egyptian religion.</p>
<p class="f">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The form and function of temples is thus very variable,though they are often considered by believers to be in some sense the "house" of one or more deities.Typically offerings of 
some sort are made to the deity,and other rituals enacted,and a special group of clergy maintain,and operate the temple.</p>
<p class="f">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  The temple-building tradition of Mesopotamia dervied from the cults of gods and deities in the Mesopotamian religion.It spanned several civilizations;from Sumerian,Akkadian
,Assyrian and Babylonian.Ancient Egyptian temples were meant as places for the deities to reside on earth.</p>
